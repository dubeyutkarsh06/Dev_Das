<h2>Welcome to eCARE. A Complete guide to the pollution in the enviornment.</h2>
<p>Our application seeks to provide the details about the air quality of
one’s surrounding, it’s hazardous effects & sources. Apart from that
it also gives us the concentration of various air pollutants in the
surrounding. The application also provides the water quality index of
the rivers in a given location. Using the water quality index we can
get information about the quality of water and the various pollutants
that are present in it. </p>
