<h2>Welcome to eCARE!<BR> A Complete Descriptiom of our app which aims to spread awareness about the pollution in the enviornment.</h2>
<p>Our application seeks to provide the details about the air quality of
one’s surrounding, it’s hazardous effects & sources. Apart from that
it also gives us the concentration of various air pollutants in the
surrounding. The application also provides the water quality index of
the rivers in a given location. Using the water quality index we can
get information about the quality of water and the various pollutants
that are present in it. </p>

    	<h3>Technology (Ionic Framework) </h3>
    	<p>Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development created by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley of Drifty Co. Use of Ionic Framework makes the application platform independent that is the application can now run on both andriod as well as iOS platforms. Apart from that complexity of application also redcues by using ionic framework.</p>
